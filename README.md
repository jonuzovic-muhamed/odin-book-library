## About
This project is part of the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Odin Project</a>'s Java Script Course, which I undertook in order to increase my knowledge in modern web development.

For this project it was necessary to create a simple single page website using vanilla HTML, CSS and Java Script in order to mimic a real Book Store/Library website.
